# Dates and Deliverables

This Computer Vision course runs from **May 27 to August 14, 2025**, meeting every Tuesday and Thursday. The curriculum progresses from fundamental concepts (image formation, processing) through core techniques (stereo vision, feature detection) to advanced topics (VAEs, diffusion models). Key deliverables include:
- **6 Quizzes** (Best 4 out of 6 considered)
- **1 Programming Assignment** 
- **Midterm exam** (July 8 2025) and **Final exam** (August 7 2025)
- **Capstone project** with milestones due July 17 and 31, presentations August 12-14

The schedule balances theory with hands-on learning, including coding exercises and a strong focus on modern generative AI applications.

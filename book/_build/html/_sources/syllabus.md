## Course Description
This course provides an introduction to the fundamental techniques in **Computer Vision and Image Processing (CVIP)** with an emphasis on physical, mathematical, and information-processing aspects of vision.  

Topics covered include:
- **Image Formation**
- **Edge Detection and Segmentation**
- **Convolution and Image Enhancement Techniques**
- **Feature Extraction (Color, Texture, Shape)**
- **Object Detection and Recognition**
- **3D Vision and Scene Understanding**
- **Computer Vision Architectures and Applications**

Additionally, the Summer 2025 version of the course extends these topics to include cutting-edge advancements in modern Computer Vision models:
- **Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)**
- **Diffusion Models (Hands-on Coding Exercise Included)**

Upon successful completion of this course, students will be able to:
1. Understand the mathematical and algorithmic foundations of Image Formation and Camera Calibration.
2. Implement image processing techniques for feature extraction and enhancement.
3. Apply convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for object detection and classification.
4. Utilize modern deep learning-based vision models such as VAEs and Diffusion Models.
5. Develop solutions for real-world vision applications in domains such as robotics, healthcare, and autonomous systems.
6. Gain hands-on experience in using libraries such as OpenCV, TensorFlow, and PyTorch for vision tasks.

## Prerequisites
- Basic knowledge of **Linear Algebra**, **Probability**, and **Calculus**.
- Proficiency in **Python Programming**.

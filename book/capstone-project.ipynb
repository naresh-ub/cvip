    "Dear Students,\n",
    "\n",
    "As a PhD researcher in Computer Vision, my primary goal for this capstone project is to **encourage creativity, hands-on exploration, and original thinking**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of assigning a fixed template project, this course gives you the freedom to choose a project that matches your skill level and personal learning goals, whether it's your first exposure to computer vision or you're preparing for graduate-level research.\n",
    "\n",
    "To help you get started, I’ve grouped projects into **three categories** so that expectations and deliverables are fair and aligned with your background.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 1: Identify your category, to balance expectations and deliverables\n",
    "\n",
    "Students in this course come from different academic and technical backgrounds. To ensure that everyone can work on a meaningful and achievable project, please identify the category that best matches your current experience with Computer Vision.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. <span style=\"background-color:#28a745;color:white;padding:1px 4px;border-radius:4px;text-decoration:none;\">Beginner</span> - **You are new to Computer Vision.**  \n",
    "   This is for students who are just getting started with image processing or machine learning. You may be an undergraduate or a graduate student taking your first CV course. The goal is to build simple, working applications and gain hands-on exposure to core concepts.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. <span style=\"background-color:orange;color:white;padding:1px 4px;border-radius:4px;text-decoration:none;\">Intermediate</span> - **You have some prior experience with CV and want to go deeper.**  \n",
    "   You may have worked on a few ML or CV projects and are comfortable using tools like OpenCV, PyTorch, or TensorFlow. The focus is on building moderately complex applications and developing skills for future internships or job roles.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. <span style=\"background-color:red;color:white;padding:1px 4px;border-radius:4px;text-decoration:none;\">Advanced</span> - **You are preparing for research or a PhD in Computer Vision.**  \n",
    "   You have significant experience with deep learning, academic reading, and model development. Your project should explore a challenging topic with clear benchmarks and may involve experimenting with recent research papers or advanced models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each category has different expectations in terms of project complexity, evaluation, and final deliverables. *You are free to choose any project from the list.*\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 2: Choose a project and form your group\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you’ve identified your category, the next step is to explore the list of curated project ideas. These span across classical vision tasks, deep learning, and generative AI, and are marked by level for easy filtering.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may work individually or in a group of up to 3 students. Every group must submit a short proposal, choose a project scope appropriate to the category of its members, and begin building.\n",
    "\n",
    "📌 If you are proposing your own idea, make sure your proposal includes:\n",
    "- A clear real-world motivation\n",
    "- A well-defined problem statement\n",
    "- Baselines or related work for comparison\n",

Welcome to CSE 4/573: CVIP course (Summer 2025). This website contains **_everything_ (all material)** for the course. To support engaging and interactive learning, this website is powered by [Jupyter Book](https://jupyterbook.org/) and the [TeachBooks](https://teachbooks.io/) package. The site hosts all course content in an accessible and interactive format, including self-hosted animated lecture slides via [Reveal.JS](https://revealjs.com/), executable live code blocks with [Thebe](https://github.com/executablebooks/thebe), rich 3D visualizations using [Plotly](https://plotly.com/python/), spaced-repetition flashcards through [JupyterCards](https://github.com/jmshea/jupytercards), and auto-graded practice quizzes via [Jupyter Quizzes](https://github.com/jmshea/jupyterquiz). This platform enhances student engagement by blending theory with hands-on experimentation directly in the browser.
